Protoclass
=========

We will use this toolbox to aggregate different method of classification in order to have some fast prototyping

Goal
----

* We assume that we already have a matrix with samples by features
* Propose some feature extractions method
* Classify using different classifiers
* Report results in terms of different statistics
